If that would be the case we would have to take counter measures." He stops for a moment while looking at you careful. "Sadly We do not have the power to see the intentions of a human being with our eyes.

			`Now that you are on a Hai world you think it would be a good opportunity to ask the Hai government how to prove yourself to the Quarg. You head to the closest embassy to ask for their support.`
			`    At the embassy a friendly Hai guides you to a waiting room where a lot of Hai are sitting before you even told what you want. Annoyed by that you sit down and wait.`
			`    After some time, you can not say how long because time in waiting rooms is flowing different, another Hai guides you to into an office. Both of you sit down. The Hai begins to talk "What can I do for you today? It is not often that we have humans here." You begin to tell the Hai your mater. While you are talking he listens carefully.`
			`    When you finished he says "That seems like something very important, I fear I am not the right person to talk to. I will hand you over to my superior. He might be able to help you." Please wait here while I go and get him.`
			`    You do not have to wait long this time until an elder Hai enters the room. The doors are closed and both of you sit silent for a short moment. The Hai begins to speak, "That is a serious matter you came here to discuss. I do not even know if we want to help you. Maybe it would be best if you start with giving us some reason. I am allowed to speak for our government so you better be cautious what you say."`

					goto early
			label separation
			`    You explain the Hai that you belief in a peaceful united galaxy where all species interact with each other. After you told that to the Hai he says that he has to talk to some people. "You have to wait here for a while." He says and leaves the room.`
			`    This time you have to wait longer. But when he comes back he has good news for you. "We do not think that you lied about your intentions, but before we help you you have to give us a proof of at least one other peacefull contact you made to a species. If you can bring us this proof we will see how we can help you.`
				goto offer

			`    You explain that you like to make contact to new species and the cultural exchange. You tell the Hai of the positive impacts on both sides of a peacefull contact. The Hai listens carefully and after you finished he says "Now I understand your noble reasons for this. I will have to go to talk to some people." He leaves the room and tells you to wait there.`
			`    You have to wait a longer period of time until he comes back. "I have good news for you. We belief you that your intentions are only this peaceful ones. We will help you if you fulfill the following condition: Bring us one other proof of a peaceful contact you made to another species."`
				goto offer
			label early
			`    You explain the Hai that you think it is best to make contact to a species as soon as possible. Because at some point in the distant future there will be contact with them anyways so it is now the best time to establish peaceful connections. After the Hai heard that he stands up and says "I will talk to some people about the things you told me.Please wait here." and leaves the room.`
			`    A long time is passing before the Hai is coming back. When he comes back he sits down and says "We are mostly sure now that you have no bad intentions. However, before we start helping you with this matter we want something from you that proves you made peaceful contact to another species. If you can get this for us we will see how we can help you.`
			label offer
			`    You ask the Hai how this prove could look like. The Hai answers "That is something I have no answer for. Maybe it would be best if you talk to government of the species. It was a pleasure to talk to you. I will see you when you got the prove. Oh, and one last thing: I might be better to not tell this species exactly why you need this." With these words he guides you to the exit and you say goodbye to him.`

			`Now that you are on a wanderer world you decide this would be a good time for asking them about the prove the Hai requested from you. You head for a near embassy.`

Please wait here for a second." He leaves the room without waiting for your respond. Forced to wait for him, you ask yourself what this gift of friendship of the wanderers could be.`

You ask him what it his but all he tells you is "It is a surprise, you will see when you get there. Take this." He hands you a small card.

			`    After you arrived at Vara K'chrai, you directly head to the embassy excited what the Wanderers will give you. At the embassy you show the small card the Wanderer gave you and a woman guides you to a separate room, where three Wanderer are standing around a table. On the table is a small plant in a pot. But you have never seen a plant like this before on any Wanderer world. One of the three begins to talk. "This plant on the table there is our gift to you. It is a genmanipulated tree, that will survive under mostly any circumstances, it is something our species is specialized on and it will show our friendship in a very unique way. We hope you like it." Surprised by this unusual gift you thank the wanderers. "It needs nearly no water, so you do not have to care a lot about it, it survives on spaceship so you can take it with you anywhere." You again say thanks to them and then you leave.`
