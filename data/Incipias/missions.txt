			`At the spaceport you are asking around for a very good translator and language scientist. One Hai finally gives you an address to go to.`
			`    When you arrive at the address you find a friendly Hai who is willed to hear what you have to say. While you are explaining he listens carefully and when you mention that the monitor began flackering he looks very interested. In the end he is more than ready to come with you.`

			`Directly after you entered the system the scientist beginns hailing the new species. "This may take a while" he says, "you better get comfortable."`
			`    After two hours he comes to you. "It seems like they understand what I am trying to do. This will make things a lot faster. But on the other hand it will take at least a day until I got some of the basics. After that we can go back and I can build you an translation device that learns while you are talking to them. This will save a lot of time."`
			`    You lean back again waiting for him to finish.`
			`    After a bit more than a day he again approaches you. "I am now finished with gathering the basics. We can now get back to my home, where I can build you the translation device."`

			`When you arrived back at the home of the scientist, he immediately begins to work. Seriously you never have seen a Hai being that excited about something. After some time passed he comes back to you. "So here are somethings you need to know", he says, "first of all they do not communicate over sounds but over light. Second ,and that is a bit more important, they do not talk like you and me via sentences and that kind of grammar but over feelings and emotions. That makes translating it to our language extremely difficult. I somehow managed to teach an AI what certain things mean, but there wont be any precise statements for you more like a general analysis of what the speaker is feeling. But I think you will get used to that. There is one other important thig right now before you go. They gave you the permission to land on their planet or stations. So make some contact."`
			`    You say goodbye to him and thank him for all of his efforts.`

			`As soon as you landed you receive a message in your ship:`
			`    The Quarg inform you that they permitt you to have contact with this species. On the other hand the Quarg also inform you that they wont allow any greater interference with the scientific progress of this species. This means that if you will sell an advanced outfit like a hyperdrive to them we will destroy it out of distance.`
			`    Surprised by that message you ask yourself how they know that you just landed. But as you received their permission to talk to them you see no problem for now. A little bit excited you want to open the shunt, but your ship informs you that you need to wear an oxygen mask because the air in the station is not breathable. Luckily you always have one in your ship. Finally you open the shunt and step out in the station.`
			`    A foogy view opens in front of you. At first you see some weird shaped ballons in the air until you realize that these are the aliens. As mentioned they look like a balloon with some tentacles on the bottom and you think you saw something that could be eyes also in the lower part. They are floating in the air and you get the feeling that all of them are looking to you. Hastily you grab your translator:`
