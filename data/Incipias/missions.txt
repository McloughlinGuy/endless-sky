But as long as you do not wish to conquer the regions of space you find, We do not mind you travelling around." He makes a short break looking at you very carefull. "On the other hand We do not know what your real goals are." For a moment you feel threatened by the presence of the Quarg, what is strange if you consider their physical strength. But tthe moment passes away and the Quarg seems friendly again. "But that aside, can I help you with something?"`

Some gave up searching and concentrated on a easier life then on endless trials and errors. But I can understand your kind. You are a young species that has not yet seen the deep darknesses that exist in this galaxy. However we wont give you any technology, you probably know that. Still I can answer you some questions if you have some."`

We are here to watch them and protect them of other species who might want harm to them." He looks at you very intense. "I hope you want no harm to them. If that would be the case we would have to take counter messures." He stops for a moment while looking at you carefull. "Sadly We do not have the power to see the intentions of a human being with our eyes. That is why we wont give you any more information about them, as long as we are not sure that you have no bad intentions. I hope you can understand that. Have you got more questions, that I can answer you?"`

			`    It does not seem like this will be easy. You remember that the Hai have some good connections to the Quarg, maybe they can give you some advice.`
